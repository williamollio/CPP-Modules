# CPP Modules

# About

The goal of this project is to introduce us [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and the [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

Here is [my notes on the vocabulary](https://github.com/williamollio/CPP-Modules/blob/master/vocab.txt).
